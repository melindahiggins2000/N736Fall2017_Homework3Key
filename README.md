# Original Assignment

## Homework 03 - due 10/10/2018

Using the HELP dataset:

  - create “Table 1”
  - provide the summary stats for the baseline data - overall and by
    randomization group (Usual Care versus the HELP Clinic)
      - HELP dataset variables to include: `age, female, racegrp,
        homeless, a15a, a15b, d1, e2b, g1b, i1, i2, pss_fr, pcs, mcs,
        cesd, treat`.
  - determine whether you want to provide parametric or non-parametric
    stats - based on your determination of normality assumptions, sample
    size considerations, appropriateness of the statistical test and
    communication with your audience.
  - include the appropriate statistical test comparing the group
    measurements and subject characteristics at baseline
  - write a statistical methods section describing (and explaining to
    your readers) the methods you used to create Table 1 and why you
    choose those methods to make the comparisons between the groups
  - write 1-2 paragraphs (as the beginning of a results section)
    describing the sample overall at baseline and by group (use the data
    you presented in Table 1 to help you).
